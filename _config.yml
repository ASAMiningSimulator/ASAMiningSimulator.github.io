about_me_description: ASA Mining Simulator is an NFT based idle game build on Algorand inspired by Rollercoin. As we work on building the UI for the full game, Miners will automaticlly send SIM rewards to your wallet every Friday, and act as NFT Staking. Half the ALGO from purchasing Miners will be put directly into LP. Purchasing and holding Miners will reward the holder with varying amounts of SIM &#x00028ID 655120757&#x00029, and other ASA&#x00027s outlined in the Miners decription.
